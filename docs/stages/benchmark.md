# Full development benchmark and aggregate telemetry

## Scope

Compare full bugfix/feature/test/refactor/API/CI/exploration lifecycles across Rust/Go/Python/IaC with independent quality and aggregate cost evidence.

## Non-goals

No performance claims from retrieval-only numbers; no private prompts/source/secrets in telemetry.

## Acceptance

Pinned scenarios, models and settings; wrong implementations fail independent tests; failures/retries/cold overhead retained; missing counters unknown; old baseline only when verified.

## Validation

just context benchmark; just check. Independent benchmark acceptance and privacy tests before cost comparisons.

## Context

Read [docs/benchmarking.md](../../docs/benchmarking.md), [docs/provenance.md](../../docs/provenance.md). Start with `just context benchmark`; follow source entry points only as needed.

## Follow-ups

No benchmark implementation or cost reduction is claimed yet. Verified legacy evidence is a prerequisite for that comparison variant.
